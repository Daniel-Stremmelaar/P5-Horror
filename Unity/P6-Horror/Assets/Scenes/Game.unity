  - "5th of April 1981, Crystal Lake \u2013 New Jersey\r\nMother and I just moved
    into the new house. I understand it wasn\u2019t cheap, but now that I am here
    it feels like we got our money\u2019s worth. The house is amazing, just standing
    in the hallway and looking around gives the immediate impression of comfort. It\u2019s
    a bit out of the way of the town itself since it is built in the forest. But we
    like the peace and quiet. That and my mom has more space to put her dolls on display,
    I don\u2019t like them but hey, she does.\r\n \r\nWe still have some work to do,
    unpack get all the furniture in place and look around to find the lake that the
    real estate agent told us was in the area. If it is close enough I think I\u2019ll
    go for a swim every now and then. Maybe I\u2019ll even see if we can restore the
    small woodland hut there, that would make for a great spot just for me. It\u2019s
    mostly intact, just needs some new stuff for inside and some patching for weak
    spots.\r\n \r\nFor now it\u2019s back to work, and tomorrow our new life begins.\r"
  - "26th of April 1981, Crystal Lake \u2013 New Jersey\r\nThis is the life! No one
    to bother me, mother lets me do what I want. Mostly at least. And with classes
    ending a month from now and mother going away for work by then I\u2019ll have
    to place to myself.\r\n \r\nI think I\u2019ll throw a party during summer break,
    with a bit of luck Jenny will come and I can show her the lake and my hut. I\u2019m
    sure she\u2019ll like that. Robby can cover for me here and run the party while
    we are gone. This summer is when I make Jenny mine.\r"
  - "18th of May 1981, Crystal Lake \u2013 New Jersey\r\nPreparations are going well,
    Robby is going to wingman and cover while I take Jenny to the lake. Martin is
    going to bring plenty of Booze and Therisa managed to get a bunch of food on the
    cheap. Everyone is going to bring stuff so we have a good time and by the end
    I am going to be a very lucky man indeed.\r\n \r\nNow to set up my hut to be a
    bit more romantic. I\u2019ve got a few candles, beer, wine and a few snacks. The
    bed is all set up. Now I wait for summer and for Jenny to follow me there. This
    will be a story to tell.\r\n"
  - "3rd of June 1981, Crystal Lake \u2013 New Jersey\r\nRobby is going to be here
    in an hour, the others should get here not too long after him. I don\u2019t really
    care about who does and doesn\u2019t show though, for me this is a way to get
    alone time with Jenny.\r\n \r\n4th of June 1981, Crystal Lake \u2013 New Jersey\r\nWell,
    everyone has left and the house is just mine again. Mine and Jenny\u2019s! We
    went steady and I did indeed get lucky. Yesterday was the best day of my life,
    and nothing could ever ruin this. In a few days my mom comes back so I\u2019ll
    have to explain why Jenny is going to be here regularly, but that should be fine,
    it\u2019s not like she has ever said no before.."
  - "11th of June 1981, Crystal Lake \u2013 New Jersey\r\nMother will come home today,
    so I am cleaning up. No need for her to know about the party. Jenny went home,
    I\u2019ll introduce them later. Of course Jenny knows about my mother already
    but I don\u2019t want to just have my mother come home to the two of us out of
    nowhere.\r\n \r\n13th of June 1981, Crystal Lake \u2013 New Jersey\r\nMother hasn\u2019t
    come home yet. At first I thought she got held up somewhere, but this is taking
    too long. She isn\u2019t the type to show up late without informing someone, and
    there hasn\u2019t been a phone call or anything. I just hope nothing bad has happened
    to her.\r\n"
  - "15th of June 1981, Crystal Lake \u2013 New Jersey\r\nI\u2019m worried now, I
    haven\u2019t heard anything about mother yet. I went to the police station and
    filed a missing person report. They said she likely just forgot to keep track
    of time shopping for dolls or something. (Yes my mother likes to collect dolls,
    I don\u2019t know why either, she just does.)\r\n \r\nAt first I thought that
    was the case too but it has been three days already, she is never this late. Even
    if she was shopping for dolls one day and a flight got cancelled the next, that
    means she should have been here already\u2026 right?\r\n"
  - "16th of June 1981, Crystal Lake \u2013 New Jersey\r\nA man showed up at the front
    door today, I had hoped it was mother ringing the bell but no. He asked me if
    he could come in, he looked like an official of sorts so I asked him if he had
    some sort of ID. He showed me an FBI badge.\r\n \r\nI didn\u2019t want to admit
    it, but this is where I already knew something was wrong and that mother probably
    wasn\u2019t coming home. Turns out I was right. The man told me that my mother
    had vanished between the 12th and the 14th. I didn\u2019t know what to say, I
    still don\u2019t. Right now I\u2019m just writing this down in hopes of coming
    to turns with it. It feels so unreal\u2026 you know?\r\n \r\nBut I guess I\u2019ll
    have to take care of myself from now on. The man told me the house and everything
    else would be left to me, so at least I have somewhere to sleep but I don\u2019t
    know how long I\u2019ll last, I don\u2019t have a job and I haven\u2019t finished
    college either. I tried calling Jenny but she isn\u2019t answering the phone.
    I\u2019m going to bed, maybe this will turn out to be a bad dream.\r\n"
  - "17th of June 1981, Crystal Lake \u2013 New Jersey\r\nIt was not a dream. I woke
    up today and I found a letter in the mailbox. The official documents declaring
    my mother dead, and me her sole heir.\r\n\r\n20th of June 1981, Crystal Lake \u2013
    New Jersey\r\nIt doesn\u2019t feel right. My mother should be here with me. But
    that is not all that feels wrong, the man that told me the information, finding
    the documents in my mailbox rather than getting them officially, hearing nothing
    from my mom while she was away, all these things feel wrong. Something here is
    wrong, and I plan to find out what. I\u2019ll look into this and trace my mother\u2019s
    steps, maybe then I\u2019ll find out what happened.\r\n"
  - "23rd of July 1981, Crystal Lake \u2013 New Jersey\r\nI\u2019ve traced my mother\u2019s
    steps for some time now and all I know for sure is that she never really left
    to begin with. There was no record of her ever getting on her plane. There are
    only two things that I ran into regularly, her obsession with dolls which seems
    to have been worse than I ever thought it was, and the lake. I don\u2019t know
    when, but apparently she got really interested in it before we moved here. Maybe
    there was more to us going here than just the peace and quiet, the people she
    worked with say she didn\u2019t talk about anything other than the lake. They
    also mentioned she wanted to go and see what was in it. I don\u2019t know what
    she was thinking, but I\u2019m going to the lake to see just what happened to
    her there.\r\n \r\n25th of July 1981, Crystal Lake \u2013 New Jersey\r\nYesterday
    was weird and unsettling. The man who told me my mother was gone knocked on the
    door again, just as I wanted to head out to the lake. He told me they found out
    what happened, she had drowned there and her body was being prepared for the funeral.\r\n
    \r\nBy now I don\u2019t trust him anymore, why does he appear now? How did they
    suddenly just find her when they first said she vanished in another country which
    she never went to? Why do they know what she told me when she didn\u2019t tell
    anyone else?\r\nI can only think of one thing, they are somehow involved, they
    are behind this. It is all their fault.\r\n"
  - "???\r\nThey are behind everything, the dolls, the lake, my mother. They caused
    it all. If you read this then burn it out of your head or they\u2019ll come for
    you too. I got my mother from the lake, she is fine now though she eats very little.
    We will make this right, our business isn\u2019t finished until this is all made
    right. Make it right you! They know, they will come. They always come. They will
    make it wrong, but we make it right. So they come and we make right. Make it right
    before they come or they will make it wrong. I will not rest until it is right.
    Mother won\u2019t rest until it is right. You won\u2019t rest until it is right.
    No one will rest until it is right. Make it right. All must be right. Must make
    it right.\r\n"

  m_Text: "5th of April 1981, Crystal Lake \u2013 New Jersey\r\nMother and I just
    moved into the new house. I understand it wasn\u2019t cheap, but now that I am
    here it feels like we got our money\u2019s worth. The house is amazing, just standing
    in the hallway and looking around gives the immediate impression of comfort. It\u2019s
    a bit out of the way of the town itself since it is built in the forest. But we
    like the peace and quiet. That and my mom has more space to put her dolls on display,
    I don\u2019t like them but hey, she does.\r\n \r\nWe still have some work to do,
    unpack get all the furniture in place and look around to find the lake that the
    real estate agent told us was in the area. If it is close enough I think I\u2019ll
    go for a swim every now and then. Maybe I\u2019ll even see if we can restore the
    small woodland hut there, that would make for a great spot just for me. It\u2019s
    mostly intact, just needs some new stuff for inside and some patching for weak
    spots.\r\n \r\nFor now it\u2019s back to work, and tomorrow our new life begins.\r"
